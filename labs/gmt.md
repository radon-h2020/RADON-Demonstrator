## Graphical Modeling Tool

Taken from the
[documentation](https://radon-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

> It enables the users to create, develop, and
> model TOSCA service templates (i.e. RADON
> models), representing the applications that are
> deployed using the RADON Orchestrator. The GMT
> is able to interact with files and folders from
> the “modeling project” inside the underlying Che
> workspace. It offers also the feature to package
> and save a CSAR of a selected RADON Model to the
> workspace in order to give the possibility to
> process it using other RADON tools or deploy it
> using the RADON Orchestrator.

All the nodes represent different entities for
that provider, being cloud provider or tool
specifics.

All the necessary nodes can be found under the
namespace “radon.nodes.aws” at the palette In the
case of AWS, all the entities we need is present:

- Api gateway
- Lambda functions
- DynamoDB
- AWS Platform

In the picture below, you can see how

![](img/2-ModelNodeTemplates.gif)

After running the rest of this lab, you will have
a model that looks similar to this one:

![](img/application-GMT2.png)

### Tasks

- Open up GMT in the right hand side of the IDE
  ![](img/open-GMT.png)
- Create a new Service Template
  ![](img/GMT-add-model.png)
  You may use whichever Namespace you want to store your 
  new service template (eg. "your_organization.servicetemplates") 
  or use the same as projected (eg. "example.org.tosca.servicetemplates")
  Using your own Namespace you can keep all your service templates in the same place.
- Give it a name (eg. "serverless-todo") and click
  add
- Click on the Topology Template tab, and click
  the `open editor` button.

## Node Types

All the necessary nodes can be found under the
namespace “radon.nodes.aws” at the palette. The
ServerlessToDoListAPI application consists of the
following node types:

- 1 AwsApiGateway
- 5 AwsLambdaFunction
- 1 AwsDynamoDBTable
- 1 AwsPlatform

### Tasks

- Model all the different nodes we need by
  dragging them into the canvas from the left pane

## Node Properties

Having the nodes without specific properties will
not help us much, so we need to input the right
configuration for this to work. On the tab
properties we populate the different properties.
GMT provides a real time error detection to
prevent the user from filing false entries.

### Tasks

Populate all the nodes with the right properties:

<details>
      <summary>AwsPlatform</summary>

```
displayName: "AwsPlatform"
properties:
  name: "AWS"
  region: "eu-central-1"
```

</details>

```

</details>

        runtime: "nodejs12.x"
        statement_id: "list-stmt"
        zip_file: "9f9fd845ed2f3b061136179467ba5f"

</details>

        env_vars: {"TODOS_TABLE":"items"}
```

</details>

## Attaching the code

All the function nodes require source code attached to be
useful. On the tab “Artifacts”, the artifacts
that accompany the lambda function can be attached
either by uploading a file or by referencing a URL
from [FunctionHub](functionhub.md).

### Tasks

- Select the `artifacts` view for the canvas.
- On each Lambda node, attach an artifact of the
  type `zip` with the following url for each

  - Get:
    `http://cloudstash.io/artifact_download/1cea0130441318a22cee6904ea971a`
  - Create:
    `http://cloudstash.io/artifact_download/36f24b63abeb3a7f70a1f1ca42077e`
  - List:
    `http://cloudstash.io/artifact_download/9f9fd845ed2f3b061136179467ba5f`
  - Update:
    `http://cloudstash.io/artifact_download/0b2516f89dbd44dc1bd03712e81db7`
  - Delete
    `http://cloudstash.io/artifact_download/07714624b3dd0c78502024164411a7`

- Under properties for each node, make sure that
  the value corresponds with the value after
  `/artifact_download` in the url above

## Node relationships

All nodes have some capabilities they offer and
some requirements they need from others.

As an example the requirement of the
AwsLambdaFunction node “HostedOn” has to be
matched with the capability of AwsPlatform node
“Host”.

![](img/4-ModelRelationships.gif)

In the end

### Tasks

- For all nodes besides `AwsPlatform`, they should
  have a requirement relationship from their
  `HostedOn` to the formers `Host` capability.
- For all Lambda functions, the requirement of
  `ConnectsTo` has to be matched with the
  capability of the DynamoDBTable node `Database`.
- `AwsApiGateway` needs to have a requirement
  relationship of `Invoker` to all lambda
  functions capability `Invokable`.
  - For all of the five relationships, some
    properties needs to be attached, listed below:

 <details>
      <summary>Get</summary>

```
properties:
  endpoint: "/todos/{id}"
  http_methods: "get"
```

</details>
<details>
      <summary>Create</summary>

```
properties:
  endpoint: "/todos"
  http_methods: "post"
```

</details>
<details>
      <summary>List</summary>

```
properties:
  endpoint: "/todos"
  http_methods: "get"
```

</details>
<details>
      <summary>Update</summary>

```
properties:
  endpoint: "/todos/{id}"
  http_methods: "put"
```

</details>
<details>
      <summary>Delete</summary>

```
properties:
  endpoint: "/todos/{id}"
  http_methods: "delete"
```

</details>

- When done, click save, and your model is done

## Finishing up

At the end of this, you should have a project
looking something like this:

![](img/application-GMT2.png)

## If something fails

If you got stuck, the example application has
already been modelled in the service templates
section called
`ServerlessToDoListAPITestingExample`.

The TOSCA file of the above service template can be found [here](servicetemplates/ServiceTemplate.tosca)

## Next step

Head over to [xOpera](xopera.md) section to deploy
your model.
